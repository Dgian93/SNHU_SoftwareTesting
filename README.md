# SNHU_SoftwareTesting
Repository for work done in the Software Testing and Automation class at SNHU. I created classes for a mobile application in Java and tested them using JUnit.


1. I can ensure that my code is functional by performing testing techniques such as black box testing that focuses on the functional requirements	. By writing test cases that correctly validate input data, class, and function behavior, I can ensure that my code meets functional and security requirements.  Additional steps for security are to use tools that focus on security such as dependency checkers and address any vulnerabilities, and to read up on security best practices for the type of program that I’m writing.

3. I interpret user needs by extracting them from sources such as user stories or requirements documentation.  I incorporate them into a program by creating the desired functionality the user has requested through the writing and testing of code.  

3. I approach designing software by first understanding the project’s functional and non-functional requirements and constraints. I think of the platforms, programming languages, libraries, frameworks, etc. that make sense for the project. I also employ test-driven development, writing tests before the code that will verify the code does what it’s supposed to and doesn’t contain defects. When writing code, I consider best practices and guidelines for consistency, readability and security.
